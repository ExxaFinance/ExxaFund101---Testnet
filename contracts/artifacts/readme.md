## üß† What Are Artifacts?

- `.json` files generated after compilation
- Include:
  - ABI (Application Binary Interface)
  - Bytecode (for deployment)
  - Compiler version and metadata
- Used by:
  - Frontend apps (React / web3.js / ethers.js)
  - Python scripts (e.g., `rebalance_scheduler.py`)
  - Test automation and deployments

## ‚öôÔ∏è How to Generate

Artifacts are typically created by:

```bash
npx hardhat compile
